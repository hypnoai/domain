Who owns Hypno.AI
The company, Hypno.AI is a georgian based philosophy organisation in and of itself it does not earn money so therefore has no owner. We like big ideas.

How can I buy your technology?
You canâ€™t, we are not selling. Pieces of technology are developed by teams of developers that our founders, partners + associates and goodwill of the developers have paid for. Hypno.AI is just a thinktank. 

Do you sell physical devices?
No! 

What exactly does your company do?
We are not here to prove to you what the value of our company or the markets we work in are worth.

Who exactly are your customers?
We specialise in technology which we use in-house, our technologies may or may not be wholy developed by ourselves and therefore exist independently of Hypno.AI.

How can I invest?
We profit share on individual products/technologies when we see shared opportunity and joint reward. These technologies are extremely expensive to develop.

What is the fundamental idea behind hypno.ai?
We believe that the great filter is neither in front of us or behind us, that it is fractal. That there is nothing particularly special about consciousness but that it is something that can be dismantled and used. We do as the universe does, and through doing this move from inside out to outside in.

What problem does your company solve?
Rather than dealing with what it means to be human, we directly engage with the parts that exist without human intervention, we use develop and build partnerships and understanding to achieve this, we believe to achieve this fully will take 10-15 years.

Can I work for Hypno.AI? 
No one works for Hypno.AI, you can work on projects under the Hypno.AI umbrella, or contribute to thought, atmosphere or entrepreneurial spirit of the organisation but to work on projects related to Hypno.AI you need to already work for a company that is developing projects that use part/s of our technologies.
